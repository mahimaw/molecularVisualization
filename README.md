# molecularVisualization
3D Molecular Visualization using Jupyter Notebook, NGLview & RDKit 

This is a 3D molecule visualisation project. 
Small Molecule data extracted from - ChEMBL (ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. It brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs.)
Protein data extracted from - RCSB PDB: Protein Data Bank

Users can use ChEMBL IDs and PDB IDs to retreive and visualise the 3D structures. 
Initial show() function will display the the Protien and second show function will display the small molecule from ChEMBL in the same diplay
